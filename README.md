The assignment aims to check students’ ability to build, implement,
validate, and evaluate an appropriate model to achieve the prediction
of credit card defaults using the given dataset. It also aims to check their
ability to identify the main challenging problems in the given dataset,
define potential solutions, and communicate/discuss the results.
The students must complete the following activities:
• Students must demonstrate their ability to implement and
validate an appropriate deep learning model to solve the given
problem.
• Students should employ theoretical concepts to build an
appropriate model and solve the problem in a systematic way.
• Students must demonstrate their ability in evaluating the
performance of the proposed model.
• Students must demonstrate their ability to professionally
communicate the results.

Tasks:
a) Design a deep learning technique for predicting credit card
defaults from the CCD (credit card default) dataset.
b) Validate and evaluate the performance of the model.
c) Write a short report (2000 words max) to describe the
architecture of the model, the training process, main deep
learning challenging problem, your findings and attempts to
cope with the challenging problem and improve the
performance of the AI system.
